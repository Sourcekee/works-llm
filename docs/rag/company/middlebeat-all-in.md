# MBP Database

## MBP - Data Models (Ontology)

***Ontology*** is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.


## Ontology for Artists

### *Name*

The official name of an artist, be it a person or a band.

### *Sort name*

The sort name is a variant of the artist name which would be used when sorting artists by name, such as in record shops or libraries. Among other things, sort names help to ensure that all the artists that start with "The" don't end up up under "T". [The guidelines for sort names](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Artist/Sort_Name) are the best place to check for more specific usage info.

### *Type*

The type is used to state whether an artist is a person, a group, or something else.

**Person**
This indicates an individual person.

**Group**
This indicates a group of people that may or may not have a distinctive name.

**Orchestra**
This indicates an orchestra (a large instrumental ensemble).

**Choir**
This indicates a choir/chorus (a large vocal ensemble).

**Character**
This indicates an individual fictional character.

**Other**
Anything which does not fit into the above categories.

Note that not every ensemble related to classical music is an orchestra or choir. The [Borodin Quartet](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/598063d1-1fc6-496a-8e91-2c21c38d8c92) and [The Hilliard Ensemble](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/c8db3d2b-19d8-4dc7-b2cb-deea37aa274a), for example, are simply groups.

### *Gender*
The gender is used to explicitly state whether a person or character identifies as male, female or neither. Groups do not have genders.

### *Area*
The artist area, as the name suggests, indicates the area with which an artist is primarily identified with. It is often, but not always, its birth/formation country.

### *Begin and end dates*
The begin and end dates indicate when an artist started and finished its existence. Its exact meaning depends on the type of artist:

**For a person**
Begin date represents date of birth, and end date represents date of death.

**For a group (or orchestra/choir)**
Begin date represents the date the group _first_ formed, and the end date represents the date when the group _last_ dissolved.

**For a character**
Begin date represents the date (in real life) when the character concept was created. The end date should not be set. These fields do not hold fictional birth and death dates.

**For others**
These fields are currently undefined for artists of the type Other.

### *IPI code*
An IPI (interested party information) code is an identifying number assigned by the CISAC database for musical rights management. See [IPI](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/IPI) for more information, including how to find these codes.

### *ISNI code*
The International Standard Name Identifier for the artist. See [ISNI](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/ISNI) for more information.

#### *Alias*
Aliases are used to store alternate names or misspellings. For more information and examples, see the [page about aliases](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Aliases).
